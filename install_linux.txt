Install Notes (0.03b)

1. Your installation directory should look like the paths below.
./monitoring/
./monitoring/agent
./monitoring/server

2.  Install Python 3.8+ for AMD64.  This can be obtained from http://python.org.  You must be running 3.8 or newer.

3.  You need to install one module.  Open an administrator cmd prompt and enter:
sudo python3.7 -m pip install pymysql

4.  You then need to set the following python scripts to start using systemd.
./monitoring/server/start_collect.py
./monitoring/server/start_event.py
./monitoring/server/start_web.py
./monitoring/agent/agent.py

5.  You will need to set IPs for the agent and the collector.  For the agent open settings.ini and change server to the IP address of the monitoring server.  For the server open settings.ini and change ipaddress to the IP of the monitoring server.

6.  You need to install MySQL or MariaDB.  After one of these is installed you need to create the monitoring database with the included script.  The configs assume a user named monitoring with a password of monitoring.  You will either have to create a sql user with these credentials or change settings.ini to account for this.

7.  To access the website go to http://localhost/ and enter admin and password.  You can change this in the GUI.

9.  The application is not set to use SSL by default.  To enable SSL: for the agent open settings.ini and change secure from False to True.  Restart the agent.  For the server open settings.ini and set secure equal to True and port_web equal to 443.
