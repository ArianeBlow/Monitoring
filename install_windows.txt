path=C:\Progra~1\Python\;C:\Progra~1\Python\Scripts\;

3.  You need to install two modules (pymysql and pywin32).  Open an administrator cmd prompt and enter:
pip install pymysql
pip install pywin32

4.  You then need to install the python scripts as services.
sc create monitoringagent displayname="Monitoring Agent" binPath="python.exe C:\Progra~1\monitoring\agent\service_agent.py" type=own error=ignore start=auto

For the agent open settings.ini and change server: to the IP address of the monitoring server.
For the collector open settings.ini and change mon_server: to the IP of the monitoring server.

6.  You need to install MySQL or MariaDB.  
After one of these is installed you need to create the monitoring database with the included script.   The configs assume a user named monitoring with a password of monitoring.  You will either have to create a sql user with these credentials or change the config files to account for this.
