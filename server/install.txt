Installation Notes

The Monitoring Server is designed to run on Linux.  As it is written in Python with no particular Linux modules or commands itcould potentially work in Windows.

1.  To install the server you must first install MySQL or MariaDB.  After you have done so you can run the two scripts to create the user and database.  You will want to lock down the user farther than what is scripte as the password is not secure.

2.  You need to chmod the mserver file.  chmod 777 mserver
3.  Run the mserver script.  sudo ./mserver
4.  You should now be able to access the website.  http://localhost:8080  Username: admin, Password:password

Farther configuration changes can be made by editing settings.ini including changing to SSL
